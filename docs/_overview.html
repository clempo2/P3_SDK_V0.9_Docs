The Technology Stack</h1>
<p>The P3 platform is a full pinball machine framework. The platform includes built-in controllable hardware that is common to most pinball machines such as flippers, slings, and cabinet buttons, as well as features unique to the P3 such as the ball-tracking infrared grid, the midfield wall and scoop assembly, and the playfield LCD. Variants of these standard features, such as alternate flipper configurations, are possible.</p>
<p>The upper portion of the playfield is a removable module that can be designed to have any combination of mechanisms and shots. Modules can be unique to a game or shared between multiple games. Deciding what to design or re-use is up to you!</p>
<p>The built-in hardware and the installed upper playfield module are both controlled by Multimorphic's P3-ROC hardware control system, which is driven by a combination of low-level libraries provided by Multimorphic: NetProc.dll, NetProcMachine.dll, and P3.dll. NetProc provides the actual hardware interface. NetProcMachine includes a framework that allows you to create modes and game logic without in-depth knowledge of the hardware implementation. P3.dll implements classes that control most of the subassemblies and functional groups of the machine, including things like the ball trough and launching subsystem, the wall/scoop module, and the ball-tracking logic.</p>
<p>Multimorphic also provides a set of classes that implement common functionality seen in most P3 pinball games. These are packaged into P3App.dll, and they include basic game structure, helper classes for controlling the physical features like LEDs and implementing standard pinball application functionality like ball save, ball search, ball launching, credit handling, player data, player profiles, game save/restore, etc. P3App.dll also contains a bunch of C# / Unity classes for implementing common GUI functionality seen on most P3 games.</p>
<p>All P3 games build off of the functionality of NetProcMachine.dll, P3.dll, P3App.dll, and the Unity game engine.</p>
<p>Unity is a well-established video game engine and development platform that enables you to develop the GUI aspect of your app - all of the interactive art that appears on the large playfield LCD. It is also the environment in which you'll develop the C# code for your game modes, using an integrated development environment called MonoDevelop. A plugin is also available to use Microsoft Visual Studio in place of MonoDevelop.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="UnityAndTheP3"></a>
Unity and the P3</h1>
<p>Because your P3 app will be a Unity-built executable, it would be easy to assume that the Unity app is the main controller of things. However, this is not the case. Unity's 3D environment is used exclusively for the visual elements of the app - the actual rules and game flow are controlled by NetProcMachine constructs called modes. When a game boots (in the Bootstrap scene), control is handed over to a class called P3Controller, which takes responsibility for all aspects of the game logic (via a collection of modes). From that point on, Unity handles only the audio-visual elements of the user experience.</p>
<p>While the modes are running the rules and flow of the game, the Unity GUI runs simultaneously and independently, exchanging information with P3Controller.</p>

Fundamental Concepts</h1>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="WhatsAGame"></a>
What's a game?</h1>
<p>While the P3 Platform is designed with pinball in mind, keep in mind that some applications for the P3 might not implement "games". Examples of non-game applications would be a jukebox app or system diagnostics.</p>
<p>The word "game" has multiple interpretations:</p><ul>
<li>A game title with all of its content (e.g. Lexy Lightspeed or Cosmic Cart Racing)</li>
<li>A multi-player game (i.e. What happens after the Start button is first pressed and the last player's final ball is drained)</li>
<li>An individual player's experience ("Player 1's game" vs "Player 3's game")</li>
<li>The executable application</li>
<li>A Unity game project edited in the Unity editor</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid confusion, clear terminology is required.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Terminology"></a>
Terminology</h1>
<p>The following terms are used when developing a P3 app:</p><ul>
<li>Title - Your complete package (e.g. Lexy Lightspeed)</li>
<li>App - An executable that can be launched on the P3. It happens to be a Unity app. It can be thought of as an instance of a title.</li>
<li>Project - The Unity project which will be edited and built in Unity</li>
<li>Game - A multi-player game (i.e. What happens between when the Start button is first pressed and the when the last player's final ball has drained)</li>
<li>P3Controller - The collection of modes that make an app, plus the mapping to the hardware.</li>
<li>Mode - A purposeful state within the app's execution. Examples include Attract mode, DoubleScore mode and Multiball mode.</li>
<li>Scene - A 3D environment in which gameplay visually occurs. A game may be played out in several scenes. In a video game, a scene could be thought of as a "level" or "zone". </li>
